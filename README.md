# **Shopping Discount Calculator**

##### 

##### The shopping discount calculator is a simple Python-based billing tool designed to help users easily calculate the total price of multiple purchased items and apply discounts during checkout. The program allows the user to enter the name, price and quantity of each item purchased. After building the item list, it provides options to apply either a percentage-based or a flat discount on the total bill. The final bill output includes an itemized list, the total before discount, the applied discount and the final amount payable.

### 

##### **Features:**

* ###### Allows entry of unlimited purchased items with name, price and quantity, showing all item details in the final bill.
* ###### Automatically calculates totals before discount and after applying discounts.
* ###### Offers two discount modes: percentage discount and flat rate discount, selectable by the user
* ###### Displays a clear, itemized bill, including all discounts and final payable amount for user transparency.

### 

##### **Technologies/Tools used:**

* ###### Python 3 (tested for standard library usage, so no external modules needed).
* ###### Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to write code.
* ###### Command-line or terminal window to run the script.

##### 

##### **Steps to Install \& Run the Project:**

* ###### Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system (download from python.org if needed).
* ###### Download or copy the script file into a folder on your computer.
* ###### Open a command prompt or terminal in that folder's location.
* ###### Execute the script.
* ###### Follow the on-screen instructions to enter items, prices, quantities, and choose discount options.

##### **Instructions for Testing:**

* ###### Run the script and perform the following manual test cases to check its correctness:

###### &nbsp;    - Add multiple items with different names/prices and verify correct totals.

######      - Test both discount types - enter a discount % discount and a flat discount, and verify that final amount is calculated properly.

######      - Try an invalid discount type to ensure error handling works.

######      - Compare output for expected totals and discounts using pen \& paper, or calculator for verification.
