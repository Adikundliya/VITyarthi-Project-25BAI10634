### **Problem Statement:**

##### Retail billing often involves calculating discounts on purchases, which can be confusing when many items and discount types are involved.

### 

### **Scope of the Project:**

* ##### The application supports unlimited item entries in a single transaction.
* ##### It calculates totals and applies two types of discounts: percentage-based and flat amount.
* ##### The solution is focused on command-line operation, and emphasizes clarity and correctness for beginner level use.

### 

### **Target Users:**

* ##### Shop owners or cashiers looking for a simple tool to automate discount calculations.
* ##### Anyone seeking an example for beginner-level retail billing automation.

### 

### **High-Level Features:**

* ##### Interactive input for item name, price and quantity.
* ##### Real-time computation of totals and application of selected discount type (percentage or flat).
* ##### Itemized bill generation showing pre- and post-discount details.
